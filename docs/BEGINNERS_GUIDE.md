# Fee Management System - Beginner's Guide

## Introduction for Newcomers

Welcome! This guide explains the complete fee management system in simple terms. Whether you're new to school administration or fee management software, this guide will help you understand how everything works together.

---

## What is This System?

Think of this system as a **complete digital solution for managing school fees** - from setting up fee structures to collecting payments, tracking defaulters, and generating reports.

**Real-World Analogy:** 
Imagine running a small shop. You need to:
1. Set prices for items (Fee Structure)
2. Sell items and give receipts (Fee Collection)
3. Track who owes you money (Defaulter Management)
4. Count cash at day-end (Reconciliation)
5. See how much you earned (Reports)

This system does all of that, but for school fees!

---

## Who Uses This System?

### 1. **Super Admin** (School Director/Principal)
- Sets up the entire system
- Approves major changes
- Views all reports

### 2. **Accounts Admin** (Accounts Manager)
- Manages fee structures
- Handles reconciliation
- Generates reports

### 3. **Fee Counter Staff** (Cashier)
- Collects fees daily
- Generates receipts
- Handles cash/cheque

### 4. **Parents** (Via Parent Portal)
- Views dues
- Pays fees online
- Downloads receipts

### 5. **Class Teachers**
- Views defaulter students
- Follows up with parents

```

### Scenario 2: Advance Payment

## Key Concepts Explained

### What is a "Fee Head"?
**Simple:** A category of fee
**Example:** Tuition Fee, Transport Fee, Library Fee

### What is a "Fee Template"?
**Simple:** A package of multiple fee heads
**Example:** "Standard Package" = Tuition + Library + Sports

### What is a "Student Ledger"?
**Simple:** Complete payment history of one student
**Example:** 
```
Rahul Kumar - Ledger
- Fee Assigned: ₹12,600
- Paid on Jan 15: ₹5,000
- Paid on Feb 10: ₹7,600
- Total Paid: ₹12,600
- Balance: ₹0
```

### What is "Reconciliation"?
**Simple:** Matching system records with bank records
**Example:**
```
System says: Collected ₹1,00,000
Bank says: Deposited ₹1,00,000
Status: ✅ Matched
```

### What is "Maker-Checker"?
**Simple:** Two-person approval for important actions
**Example:**

Maker (Staff): Requests refund of ₹10,000
Checker (Principal): Reviews and approves
Then: Refund processed
```
